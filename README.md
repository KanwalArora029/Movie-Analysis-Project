Project Goals:
Explore 2018 movie revenue data by genre and market (foreign vs. domestic) to determine what genre movie to produce next and whether it will make more revenue domestically or in non-domestically


Can we look at 2018 to determine which genres in what markets will perform best?
What genres produce the most revenue?
How does foreign vs domestic market affect revenue?
Can we choose what genre we should produce based on the revenues of 2018 films?
Will certain genres generate more in domestic v foreign markets?


Findings:
Action or Family films perform best in terms of aggregate revenue and average revenue, respectively
